# Introduction

The AMIgen utilities are typically used to generate AMIs from a starting-point (or, "bootstrap") AMIs. The starting-point AMIs may be selected from the AWS Marketplace (or CSP's equivalent), public AMIs or private AMIs. These starting-point AMIs must be the same distribution as the creation-target for the AMIgen scripts (e.g., use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting-point to create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux final AMI; use a Alma Linux starting-point to create a Alma Linux final AMI; etc.).

# Usage

Depending on your CSP's environment, there may be no suitable starting-point AMIs to use. If such is the case, use a procedure similar to the following to create such starting-point AMIs.

## Execute a `chroot()`-style build

1. Launch an EL8 AMI (probably RHEL8), ensuring that a secondary disk of at least 8GiB in size is attached
1. Install the `@development` package-group to the resultant EC2
1. Login to the EC2
1. Change to the `root` user (e.g., `sudo -i`)
1. Generate an RPM manifest suitable for your distro-clone (the ones marked `Mandatory` and `Default` from CentOS8 stream should be sufficient)
1. Clone the AMIgen8 project (this project) to the `root` user's `${HOME}`
1. Navigate into the AMIgen8 project-root (e.g., `cd AMIgen8`)
1. Use the `XdistroSetup.sh` script to stage the necessary alternate-disto GPG and repository files to the build-environment:
    ~~~
    ./XdistroSetup.sh -d <DISTRO_NAME> \
      -k <URL_TO_GPG_KEYFILE_1>,<URL_TO_GPG_KEYFILE_2>,...,<URL_TO_GPG_KEYFILE_n>, \
      -r <URL_TO_DISTRO_RELEASE_FILE_1>,<URL_TO_DISTRO_RELEASE_FILE_2>,...,<URL_TO_DISTRO_RELEASE_FILE_n>,
    ~~~
    For Rocky Linux 8, this would look something like:
    ~~~
    ./XdistroSetup.sh -d RockyLinux \
      -k https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/RPM-GPG-KEY-rockyofficial \
      -r https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/r/rocky-release-8.5-2.el8.noarch.rpm,https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/r/rocky-repos-8.5-2.el8.noarch.rpm
    ~~~
1. (Optional) Clean up target-disk by executing:
    ~~~
    ./Umount.sh -C <TARGET_DEV>
    ~~~
1. Partition the target-disk by executing:
    ~~~
    ./DiskSetup.sh -B 1024 -d <TARGET_DEV> -f xfs -r <FILESYSTEM_LABEL>
    ~~~
    Note: Selection of EXTn filesystem-types is also supported. Change the above `xfs`  and all following `xfs` references, as necessary, if an EXTn filesystem-type is chosen, instead.
1. Mount the target-disk by executing:
    ~~~
    ./MkChrootTree.sh -d <TARGET_DEV> -f xfs -m /mnt/ec2-root --no-lvm
    ~~~
1. Install the OS packages by executing:
    ~~~
    ./OSpackages.sh -a <LIST_OF_CHANNEL_NAMES> \
      -m /mnt/ec2-root -r /root/RPM/<DISTRO_NAME>/<DISTRO_RELEASE_RPM> \
      -X -M <MANIFEST_FILE>
    ~~~
    For Rocky Linux 8, this would look something like:
    ~~~
    ./OSpackages.sh -a baseos,appstream,extras \
      -m /mnt/ec2-root -X \
      -r /root/RPM/RockyLinux/rocky-repos-8.5-2.el8.noarch.rpm,/root/RPM/RockyLinux/rocky-release-8.5-2.el8.noarch.rpm \
      -x subscription-manager,redhat-rpm-config,rhn-check,rhn-client-tools,rhn-setup,rhnlib,rhnsd \
      -M <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>
    ~~~
    Note: Due to environment-inheritance when using a RHUI-enabled AMI, it's necessary to:
    * Exclude (with `-x`) all RPMs related to RHUI-enablement
    * Use a manifest-file rather than the groups-metadata that come from the RHUI repos
    * Staging the RPMs referenced with the `-r` flag is optional: if your build-host is able to pull those files from an anonymous repo, then the `-r` can be pointed to the relevant URLs. See per-platform notes below.
    * If bootstrapping to Oracle Linux 8, it will be necessary to export the `DNF_VAR_ocidomain` and `DNF_VAR_ociregion` environment variables. If using Oracle's public repositories, the values are `oracle.com` and `""`, respectively

1. (Optional) Install the AWS utilities by executing:
    ~~~
    ./AWSutils.sh -d ~/RPM/Amazon/ \
      -c <URL_OF_AWSCLIv2_BUNDLE> \
      -s <URL_OF_AWS_SSM_AGENT_RPM> \
      -m /mnt/ec2-root
    ~~~
    This will typically look something like:
    ~~~
    ./AWSutils.sh -d ~/RPM/Amazon/ \
      -c https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip \
      -s https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-us-east-1/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm \
      -m /mnt/ec2-root
    ~~~
    Note: If bootstrapping to Oracle Linux 8, see `DNF_VAR_*` note in the prior step
1. Apply SELinux labels, install GRUB2 stuff, etc., by executing:
    ~~~
    ./PostBuild.sh -f xfs -m /mnt/ec2-root -X -z <PREFERRED_TIMEZONE>
    ~~~
    This will typically look something like:
    ~~~
    ./PostBuild.sh -f xfs -m /mnt/ec2-root -X -z UTC
    ~~~
    Note: To ensure that the resultant AMI is _not_ FIPS-enabled, add the `--no-fips` long-option. Similarly, to ensure that `/tmp` is not set up as a `tmpfs` pseudo-filesyste, add the `--no-tmpfs`long-option.
1. Unmount the disk by executing:
    ~~~
    ./Umount.sh -c /mnt/ec2-root
    ~~~

## Create Image

Once the above, `chroot()`-style build to the secondary volume has successfully completed, you are ready to create an AMI from that secondary disk:

1. Using the AWS CLI or web-console, Snapshot the secondary volume
1. Create a suitable `blockmap.json` template-file. Contents should look like:
    ~~~
    [
        {
            "DeviceName": "/dev/sda1",
            "Ebs": {
                "DeleteOnTermination": true,
                "SnapshotId": "__SNAPSHOT_ID__",
                "VolumeSize": __SIZE__,
                "VolumeType": "gp2"
            }
        }
    ]
    ~~~
    Note: `gp2` is the "normal" value. However, any EBS-type that's valid for the partition/region can be substituted. Simply be aware that select other than `gp2` may limit the instance-types that the resultant AMI can be launched as.
1. Monitor the snapshot's creation.
1. When the snapshot completes, register an image of it with something like:
    ~~~
    aws ec2 register-image \
      --virtualization-type hvm \
      --architecture x86_64 \
      --ena-support \
      --sriov-net-support simple \
      --root-device-name /dev/sda1 \
      --block-device-mappings "$(
          sed -e 's/__SIZE__/8/' -e 's/__SNAPSHOT_ID_/<SNAP_ID_FROM_1>/' /root/blockmap.json
        )" \
      --name "MyBootstrapAMI-YYYY.MM.N.x86_64-gp2" \
      --description "\"boostrap\" image for Rocky Linux 8.5 (current through 2021-12-21)"
    ~~~

## Validate Image

The above processes have been shown to reliably work for:

* Creating a CentOS 8 Core (now deprecated)
* Creating a CentOS 8 Stream
* Creating an Alma Linux 8
* Creating a Rocky Linux 8

When starting from an official Red Hat 8 AMI from the AWS MarketPlace (i.e., one maintained via CSP/Red Hat partnership). While this project has generically validated these scenarios, it is still a good idea to validate your results before trying to use your bootstrap AMI for AMI-building or other purposes. To do so:

1. Using the AWS CLI or web-console, launch an EC2 from your new bootstrapper AMI:
    * Ensure you launch it with an accessible SSH key
    * Ensure you launch it into an availability-zone reachable from your administration host
    * Ensure you attach a security-group that allows SSH-based access to the EC2 from your administration host
1. Monitor the EC2's startup. It should be ready to SSH into within 2-5 minutes. If the EC2 does not pass the two start-checks before then, the AMI is probably broken
1. SSH into the EC2's provisioning-user's account. Unless you have overridden this user either during the AMI-creation process or via the EC2's userData contents, the provisioning-user's account is `maintuser`
1. Elevate privileges to `root` (`sudo -i` should work without prompting for password)
1. Verify that the EC2 is running the expected Linux-distribution and release-level; executing `cat /etc/os-release` should produce output similar to:
    ~~~
    NAME="Rocky Linux"
    VERSION="8.5 (Green Obsidian)"
    ID="rocky"
    ID_LIKE="rhel centos fedora"
    VERSION_ID="8.5"
    PLATFORM_ID="platform:el8"
    PRETTY_NAME="Rocky Linux 8.5 (Green Obsidian)"
    ANSI_COLOR="0;32"
    CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:rocky:rocky:8:GA"
    HOME_URL="https://rockylinux.org/"
    BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.rockylinux.org/"
    ROCKY_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Rocky Linux"
    ROCKY_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="8"
    ~~~
1. Verify that FIPS-mode is set as expected (`cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled`). By default, FIPS-mode will be enabled
1. Verify that the system consists of a single partition (e.g., `df -PHt xfs`)
1. Verify that the `/etc/fstab` file looks correct. This should be something like:
    ~~~
    LABEL=root_disk /       xfs     defaults         0 0
    ~~~
1. Verify that the `tmp.mount` service is active and that `/tmp` is a `tmpfs` filesystem:
    ~~~
    # systemctl status -l tmp.mount
    ‚óè tmp.mount - Temporary Directory (/tmp)
        Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
        Active: active (mounted) since Tue 2021-12-21 12:52:26 UTC; 3h 32min ago
          Where: /tmp
            What: tmpfs
            Docs: man:hier(7)
                https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/APIFileSystems
          Tasks: 0 (limit: 22949)
        Memory: 4.0K
        CGroup: /system.slice/tmp.mount
    ~~~
    And:
    ~~~
    # df -Ph /tmp
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    tmpfs           1.8G  4.0K  1.8G   1% /tmp
    ~~~
1. Verify that the EC2 can talk to its `yum` repositories; executing `yum repoinfo | grep -E '^Repo-(name|pkgs)'` should produce output similar to:
    ~~~
    Last metadata expiration check: 0:01:00 ago on Tue Dec 21 16:02:16 2021.
    Repo-name          : Rocky Linux 8 - AppStream
    Repo-pkgs          : 6677
    Repo-name          : Rocky Linux 8 - BaseOS
    Repo-pkgs          : 1837
    Repo-name          : Rocky Linux 8 - Extras
    Repo-pkgs          : 37
    ~~~
1. Verify that the new AMI is fully up-to-date:
    ~~~
    # yum list updates
    Last metadata expiration check: 0:07:11 ago on Tue Dec 21 16:02:16 2021.
    #
    ~~~
    Note: If there are updates available, it's best to generate a new boostrap AMI and re-verify.
1. Verify that the AWS CLI is present:
    ~~~
    # find -L / -xdev -name aws -executable -type f
    /usr/local/bin/aws
    /usr/local/aws-cli/v1/bin/aws
    /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/2.4.6/dist/aws
    /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/2.4.6/bin/aws
    /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/dist/aws
    /usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/bin/aws
    ~~~
1. Verify that the Amazon SSM agent is present:
    ~~~
    # rpm -qa amazon-ssm-agent
    amazon-ssm-agent-3.1.715.0-1.x86_64
    ~~~
1. If sharing the image, either set the image public (to be a good community-citizen) or share to the list of accounts that need to have access
1. If the bootstrap-images need to be multi-region (mostly if trying to be a good community-citizen), ensure to copy the verified-AMI from the region it was created in to any other region it should exist within.
